2019-11-18 17:05  0.3.3
  * Ensure that calling tickit_window_close(3) twice doesn't crash
    (thanks noctux)
  * Conditionally #define feature-test macros only on __GLIBC__ because other
    OSes (e.g. the BSDs) use those macros to hide symbols (LP1824791)
  * Make sure that examples build with $(CC) rather than hardcoded gcc
  * Account for X10's lack of mouse button reporting on release events
  * Avoid SEGV on shutdown if windows get closed after their parent

2019-04-12 16:35  0.3.2
  * #define _POSIX_C_SOURCE as some platforms need it
  * Hide terminal cursor around redraws
  * Fix bug in terminal output buffering logic around split writes
  * Default 4096 byte output buffer in toplevel Tickit instance
  * Skip screen-based terminfo test if loading terminfo fails, due to ongoing
    unibilium issue

2019-04-10 21:03  0.3.1
  * Avoid nested functions in unit tests as some versions of gcc dislike this
  * Bugfixes and unit test for ti_hook
  * Fix various (harmless) warnings from noisy C compilers
  * Use only one standard streq() macro across all source
  * Fix signature of render() in examples/demo-scroll.c
  * Fix documentation of tickit_utf8_ncountmore(3) to include len param (LP1797763)
  * Have TICKIT_TERMCTL_COLORS return (1<<24) on RGB8-capable terminals

2019-03-17 22:11  0.3
  * Renamed:
      + tickit_timer_after_msec => tickit_watch_timer_after_msec
      + tickit_timer_after_tv   => tickit_watch_timer_after_tv
      + tickit_later            => tickit_watch_later
      + tickit_timer_cancel     => tickit_watch_cancel
  * Added toplevel Tickit functions for loop control
      + tickit_tick(3)
      + tickit_watch_io_read(3)
      + tickit_watch_timer_at_epoch(3)
      + tickit_watch_timer_at_tv(3)
  * Added TickitType
      + tickit_term_ctltype(3)
  * Added window controls
      + tickit_window_getctl_int(3)
      + tickit_window_setctl_int(3)
      + tickit_window_ctlname(3)
      + tickit_window_lookup_ctl(3)
      + tickit_window_ctltype(3)
  * Added toplevel Tickit instance controls
      + tickit_getctl_int(3)
      + tickit_setctl_int(3)
      + tickit_ctlname(3)
      + tickit_lookup_ctl(3)
      + tickit_ctltype(3)
  * TICKIT_PEN_UNDER type is now integer, supports single, double, wavy underline
  * Fixed various example/demo-*.c files so they work again
  * Added experimental new ability to provide event loop hooks for other event
    loops
  * Deleted the deprecated tickit_string_* functions that were renamed to
    tickit_utf8_*
  * Renumbered TICKIT_PEN_* constants to start from 1; lists can end with 0
  * Use termios to know what backspace (VERASE) character is, rather than
    relying on terminfo - experience from vim, neovim, etc.. is that this is
    often more reliable
  * tickit_watch_* callbacks now receive an info pointer, to match the calling
    style of other object bindings

2018-01-05 14:47  0.2
  * Added tickit_window_{is,set}_steal_focus(3)
  * Added entire toplevel Tickit instance
