.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtickit_later\fP() registers a callback function to be invoked by the toplevel event loop as it processes the next round of IO events. A registered callback will be invoked by a running call to \fBtickit_run\fP(3). The callback function will be invoked once, and then destroyed afterwards.
.PP
When invoked, the callback function is always passed both \fBTICKIT_EV_FIRE\fP and \fBTICKIT_EV_UNBIND\fP flags to its \fIflags\fP argument. If the callback had been registered with the \fBTICKIT_BIND_DESTROY\fP flag, then it will also be invoked with the \fBTICKIT_EV_DESTROY\fP flag if it has not yet been invoked by the time the toplevel instance is destroyed.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fBtickit_later\fP() returns no value.
